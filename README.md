# Superscript (Alfred Workflow)

Superscript is an Alfred 5 workflow that formats selected text into superscript using Unicode superscript characters.

## ðŸ”§ Usage
- Open Alfred's search bar
- Trigger the workflow with your assigned keyword (e.g., `sup`)
- Type a character or string
- Output will convert regular characters to superscript equivalents where possible and paste directly into the app you are typing in

## ðŸ›  Purpose
Built for quick formatting and aesthetic tweaks in code comments, messages, and notes.

---

## ðŸ§  Source

This workflow is defined entirely by `info.plist`, which contains Alfred's internal configuration and automation logic.

You can view it here: [`src/info.plist`](./src/info.plist)

There are no external scripts or dependencies â€” all behavior is handled using Alfred's built-in actions.
